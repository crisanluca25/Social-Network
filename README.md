## Why is this Project Special? 🌟

This project is more than a database application—it’s a fully object-oriented solution, incorporating:

- Encapsulation: Protecting data and maintaining clean interactions.
- Inheritance: Reusing logic to simplify the codebase.
- Polymorphism: Implementing dynamic behaviors for various entities.
- Abstraction: Streamlining complex logic into manageable components.

By combining clean code principles with practical functionality, this project offers a thoughtful and well-structured solution.
